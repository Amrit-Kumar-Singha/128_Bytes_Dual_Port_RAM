# Designing a 128 Bytes Dual Port RAM Using Cadence Genus and Innovus

## Project Overview

The objective was to design a 128 Bytes Dual Port RAM, a fundamental component in many digital systems. This design features dual ports, allowing simultaneous read and write operations, enhancing performance in various applications.

## Steps Involved

### üñ•Ô∏è Verilog Design
- Developed a Verilog module for the 128 Bytes Dual Port RAM, focusing on optimizing memory operations for efficiency and dual port functionality.

### üîß Synthesis with Genus
- Used Cadence Genus to synthesize the Verilog code into a gate-level netlist.
- Applied constraints and performed optimizations to balance performance and area.

### üèóÔ∏è Place-and-Route with Innovus
- Imported the synthesized netlist into Cadence Innovus for physical design.
- Conducted floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing.
- Ensured the design adhered to all timing, area, and power specifications.

## Highlights
- Successfully addressed and overcame design constraints and optimization challenges.
- Produced detailed reports covering area, gate count, power consumption, and timing analysis.
- Achieved a functional and verified physical layout, ready for fabrication.
